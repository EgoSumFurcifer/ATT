		<p>Copyright 2021. Me, Myself, and I. I don't really know what you are supposed to put in this section, but it is always boring copyright 
laws and things. They somtimes add credits too? That still seems kind of boring. I guess just give me credit for the website and Alex and Terran for the games? I don't really know. I doubt anyone will read this anyway.</p>
